# Machine-Learning-Assignment-1
**Predicting Profits for Restaurant**

Introduction:

In modern rapidly evolving global, making well-knowledgeable decisions is paramount, mainly in domain names like investments and business ventures. Real property stands proud as an area in which accurate predictions can wield extensive impact. With technological improvements, gadget mastering algorithms have emerged as strong gear for forecasting housing fees with terrific precision. This undertaking delves into the area of predictive analytics, aiming to predict the profitability of cities based on their populace.

Installation:

Before immersing your self in the assignment, ensure Python three.X is mounted in your gadget together with vital libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-analyze, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. You can swiftly install these libraries the use of pip:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-analyze matplotlib seaborn

Usage:

To kickstart this challenge, comply with these truthful steps:

Clone the repository on your local environment.

Navigate to the task listing.

Open the C1_W2_Linear_Regression.Ipynb script using Jupyter Notebook or any like minded platform. Data:

The excellent of the dataset bureaucracy the cornerstone of any device learning mission. In this endeavor, we utilize two datasets: ex1data1.Txt and ex1data2.Txt. These datasets furnish data approximately metropolis population and earnings, serving as the spine for our predictive model.

Model:

The crux of our prediction lies within the Linear Regression set of rules. This model undergoes training at the furnished dataset to set up a correlation between populace and profit consistent with city. Through iterative refinement, the version adjusts its parameters to as it should be expect income based on various population sizes.

Results:

Upon execution of the script, youâ€™ll witness the prowess of predictive analytics as the model unveils insights into metropolis profitability. Visualizations, which includes graphs illustrating populace as opposed to profit in keeping with metropolis, offer valuable views on statistics and version performance.

Contributing:

Collaboration is indispensable to this venture, and contributions from all fanatics are welcome. Whether you have got hints for development or aspire to add new functions, your input is notably valued. Feel unfastened to raise issues or put up pull requests to make a contribution to the development of this challenge.

In end, the convergence of device studying and real estate gives an interesting avenue for predictive analytics. By harnessing the energy of algorithms, we are able to make knowledgeable decisions, in the end shaping the trajectory of investments and business techniques. Join us in this adventure as we explore the dynamic landscape of city earnings prediction.
